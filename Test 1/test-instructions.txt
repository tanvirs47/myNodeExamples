   AVIVA FRONT END DEVELOPMENT CODING TEST

==========================================================================


Here are Photoshop and JPEG designs of a fictional Aviva web page shown in 
both small and large screen views. 

Please spend up to 4 hours building a responsive web page based upon these
designs, including any HTML, CSS and JavaScript you feel is necessary. It
is ok if you do not produce a complete page, just complete whatever you can
within the time given as the result will be primarily assessed on the 
quality of the code produced.

The aim of the test is to assess your coding ability and so if you use any 
libraries or frameworks to assist in your build then please clearly indicate 
which code is your own and which is not. Please avoid using a build process 
if possible. If you do need to use one then please include the compiled 
files as well as the originals.

1. Bootstrap - for responsive designing

3. Fontawesome for icons
5. Style.css is written by myself.
